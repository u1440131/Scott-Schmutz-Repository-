        "- Load the Airbnb dataset you cleaned and transformed in Assignment 7\n",
        "- Build a linear regression model to predict listing price\n",
        "- Interpret which features most affect price\n",
        "- Try to improve your model using only the most impactful predictors\n",
        "- Practice explaining your findings to a business audience like a host, pricing strategist, or city partner\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Pricing is one of the most important levers for hosts and Airbnb’s business teams. Understanding what drives price — and being able to predict it accurately — helps improve search results, revenue management, and guest satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment gives you hands-on practice turning a cleaned dataset into a predictive model. You’ll focus not just on code, but on what the results mean and how you’d communicate them to stakeholders.\n",
